# SCPlayer - Spotify Connect Player

Troubleshooting
----------------

If you are running on Openelec like I am, you have to run this command to enable alsa drivers<br/>
from ssh type "`echo snd_bcm2835 >> /storage/.config/modules-load.d/audio.conf`"<br/>
and reboot

If you are running on OSMC you have to run this command to enable alsa drivers<br/>
from ssh type "`sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835`"<br/>
no need to reboot


Disclaimer

Using this code to connect to Spotify's API is probably forbidden by them, and might result in your application key getting banned. Use at you own risk
